An "above average" React Native app that shows a few of the most common features apps need:
- Navigation between scenes
- Drawer Navigation
- Login API call
- Animations and transitions
- Native library integrations (graphs, SVG icons, etc.)
- e2e tests

Features that didn't make it to this release (yet):
- Redux state management
- Form validation
- Pretty loading indicators
- More animations and more scenes
- Websockets
- Push notifications
- ... and so on ...
